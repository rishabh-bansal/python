"Breaking the myth of Life!"

"Hey, how you have been? what are you doing these days?"
"I'm good, I'm currently pursuing my higher studies! Wbu?"
"Nothing, just got a job with 14lakh annual package!"
"Wow! That's great!"

No actually not great. 
You must have been at one point in your life, where you thought 'was it worth it?' and you just make that thought away by 'that's life, I can do nothing with it'.
We all are trapped in a vicious life cycle, where we are meant to go to high school for 12 years, then higher studies, more higher studies, job, and finally getting at that age where you don't have enough energy to fulfill what you actually wanted to do in your whole life.
And the intersting part is that all of this is just for some money. We all know "Money can't buy happiness" but deep inside, we know we can't survive without it.
Whoever said, “money can’t buy happiness” is either poor or wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. The incessant amount of studies by researchers trying to prove money can’t buy happiness is simply a result of the researcher’s own poverty or unhappiness. Because they are financially mediocre, researchers are trying to console themselves that it’s OK not being wealthy.
But priorty is what that matters, it totally depends on if you can actually enjoy your money. If you work 100 hours a week and have all the money you want, are you really going to be happy? Maybe not. Life is short, try to live every second of it, do what you want to do, work on something that is your interest. And atlast money is not what your'e going to take with yourself, the name you earned, the respect you earned, is what will remain forever. Don't follow the crowd, break that life cycle, and do something different.
